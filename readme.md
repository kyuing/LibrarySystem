* Implemented a command line JAVA program that manages book data in a library system with a focus on data structures and algorithms (search & sort). 

* Requirements:
  - On the program execution, load data in the form of objects from text files.
  - Search for a book by title and/or author.
  - List all books by title and/or author name in alphabetical order.
  - Search for a reader by name and/or ID.
  - List all readers in alphabetical and/or ID order.
  - Register that a reader has borrowed a book.
  - Add readers to a waiting queue if a book is borrowed and another reader wants to borrow the same book
  - Register that a reader has returned a book.
  - Update a waiting queue on book return and display the next reader If the book has readers in the waiting queue.
  - List the books that readers have borrowed on request.
  - Keep updating and adding new records/changes to the text files.
